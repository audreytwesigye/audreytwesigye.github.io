### Hi, I'm AudreyðŸ‘‹

I'm a biomedical engineer, from Uganda and living in the UK. On a day to day basis, I work in biomaterials and regenerative medicine, based in Oxford. In my free time, I am learning to code, and exploring the world of Tech ðŸ˜ƒ. I'm hoping to combine both these experience and venture into digital health and healthcare technology, with a focus on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. 

How am I learning?
- [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)
- [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)
- And ofcourse, personal projects ðŸ’ƒ

Check out some of my recent projects below, and feel free to always leave me some feedbackðŸ˜Š
